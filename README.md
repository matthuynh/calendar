Productivity Suite - a calendar application

Welcome! This program was created as part of a final project in a high school computer science course.
Productivity Suite is a calendar that can save events for a chosen date.

To run and compile the source files in Java, use all of the .java files in the src folder.
The bgColor.txt, cdColor.txt, and Events.txt files are used to save user preferences for the colour themes of the program and the events themselves.

The productivitysuite.jar file can be run indepently of the other files in this repository for a fully working version of the application.
It is recommended to run the .jar file on a Windows machine. The application has not been fully tested on other operating systems, so certain elements
of the application such as the Swing graphics may not appear as intended.
